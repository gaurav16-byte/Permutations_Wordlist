# This creates wordlists based on your arguments

## Argument order is 

'--type [len] [word] [filename]'

**Advantage over crunch tool - Less size wordlist completely based on Python_3**

### Ex. usage python3 wordlist.py --p/ --pr / --c /--cr 5 goodmorning file
1. Here 5 is the length of the passwords in the wordlist
2. goodmorning is the word
3. file is the filename
