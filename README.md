# This creates wordlists based on your arguments

## Argument order is 

'''
 --type [len] [word] [filename]
'''

*Next update will contain support for multiple words but for now provide the characters as required. *
**Advantage over crunch tool - Less size wordlist completely based on Python_3**

### Ex. usage python3 wordlist.py 5 goodmorning file
*Here 5 is the length of the passwords in the wordlist
*goodmorning is the word
*file is the filename
